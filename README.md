# Fourier Transform
Details of each file are shown below.


## ft.js
In file "ft.js", Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) are implemented.

It contains main function that is located in the part of "window.onload".

Here, it outputs the results of DFT and FFT in a "Console" part.


## complex.js
For basic calculation of complex number (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponential), we use "Complex Class" in file "complex.js".


## FourierTransform.pdf
The pdf file "FourierTransform.pdf" contains the explanation of the theory and the derivation of the formula in Japanese.

At the last part, it describes an idea for implementation of FFT.
