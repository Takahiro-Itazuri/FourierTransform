# Fourier Transform
Details of each file are shown below.

## Reference
### FT Class (in "ft.js")
In this class, DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) and FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) are implemented. Furthermore, visualization method also be implemented (2017/08/25).

```js
function FT(nsample, f , type)
```

## complex.js
For basic calculation of complex number (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponential), we use "Complex Class" in file "complex.js".


## FourierTransform.pdf
The pdf file "FourierTransform.pdf" contains the explanation of the theory and the derivation of the formula in Japanese.

At the last part, it describes an idea for implementation of FFT.
